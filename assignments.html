Coming Soon!

<br />
Assignments should be submitted to git. We will review this in class.
<br /><br />


A1a.<br />
Before the end of ___ ::::A1a::::<br />
- Write out a conceptual painting. Following in the tradition of conceptual artists like Sol Lewitt write a recipe or instruction based artwork in natural language, develop a set of instructions for a dynamic abstract painting. Review Sol LeWitt's retrospective at MASSMoca (you can click on the thumbnails to see the instructionals), as well as Casey Reas' exploration of his work in Software Structures. Keep in mind that you will be passing this recipe on to a fellow classmate who will turn the instructions into Processing code.... The assignment will be graded based on its formulaic presentation in relationship to the code environment and algorithmic structures. More on this assignment coming soon. 

<br /><br />


A1b.<br />
Due before class on ___ ::::A1b:::: <br />
Using object oriented programming and functions, implement the instructional/ conceptual painting written by a fellow student in Processing. Consider the elements of the recipe/ instructional you received. Can they be translated into variables, and methods, inside of classes that you create? Simplifying where necessary, implement the recipe using the Processing coding environment using all of the main programming concepts introduced to date, including at least one class. More on this assignment coming soon. 


<br />
<br />

A2.<br />
Due by the end of the day on Nov 30 ::::A2::::<br />
You will receive a conceptual painting made in Processing from a fellow student. For this assignment, you will use this code to create a textured sound environment using Arduino. Use motors, piezos and other elements to create an emergent, textured and mechatronic soundscape based on events occurring in the conceptual drawing. Due by the end of the day on November 30. The code for this assignment should be highly commented, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the code you were given, where you altered it and why. Comments should also demonstrate an understanding of how the electronic and mechatronic environment is working. Final project includes ALL CODE, comments and a comprehensive VIDEO documenting all aspects of your mechatronic sound environment. 20% of grade.
